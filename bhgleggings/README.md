# Latex Patterns for Butt-Hip-Gaff Leggings

I've been searching for the perfect latex leggings. My ideal leggings will, in a single item

* Hold in silicone hip pads
* Act as a Gaff, but allow toilet breaks
* Hold in foam butt pads
* Give a nice butt definition

So can we come up with a design like that? This is my first attempt. It's based on a duct-tape pattern but I've modified the pattern so it should be able to scale to measurements. It's not as refined a work as
my pocket-top, so you'll need to do some work to get a nice pattern out of this.

I used

* 0.4mm latex in black for the main parts
* 1mm latex in black for the gaff part
* A random zip I had handy

For the prototype I only made the leggings extend to just above the knee (because I ran out of black .4mm latex). A future prototype will include full legs too.

I'm probably 70% happy with the design as it stands; it's better than anything else I've owned. I do feel we can make it even better though.
