# Part 1 : Introduction

I've been searching for the perfect latex inflatable hips.

So can we come up with a design that takes the all the best ideas, make it fairly simple to pattern and construct, and then make the pattern available for all?

I started with a catsuit pattern I already had and tweaked it.

So if you fancy making one yourself or are just interested in my process, follow along! Note that although it may seem much cheaper to make one yourself, by the time you have invested in the sheeting, tools, proper glue and thinner, and not forgetting your time, you'll wonder how any of the latex clothing companies make any profits at all!

Here's what I needed for making the hips:

* 0.5mm latex in Radical Rubber mannequin. I ended up using about 2.5m in length.
* The proper glue and thinner and all the accessories you'd usually use to make later (see later)

And here's how long it took:

* Pattern printing, cutting it out: 1 hour
* Transferring to latex, cutting it out: 2 hours
* Latex assembly: 8 hours

Now on to part 2, downloading and adjusting the pattern: https://github.com/kigyui/latexpatterns/blob/master/inflatablehips/02-pattern.md
