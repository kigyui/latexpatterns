# Latex Patterns

A collection of patterns and construction notes on various latex items. Feel free to use these, I've put them under the Apache 2.0 license. If you make use of them please do let me know and tag me if you do, a lot of time went into creating these and its good to know that they're useful and being used before making more of them public.
